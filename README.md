# TemplateBuilder
Build Web Page Templates that are eventually going to be part of the Report Builder which will enable you to build a template in a way that is printable. For now, just making a Simple Web Page Builder from a Web Page itself.

Some pages I found while looking into approaches taken by people trying to do similar things:
- [Using the HTML5 Drag and Drop API](https://web.dev/drag-and-drop/)
- [Building a seamless Drag and Drop Interface](https://blog.stackhive.com/post/137799349684/building-a-seamless-drag-and-drop-interface)
